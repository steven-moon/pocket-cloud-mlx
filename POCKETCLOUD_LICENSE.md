# PocketCloud License & Governance

**PocketCloud is free for personal use, small businesses, and startups. Commercial licenses apply when the technology becomes core to significant revenue.**

---

## 📋 License Philosophy

PocketCloud follows an **open-source-first, sustainable** licensing model designed to:

- **Free Access**: Enable everyone to run private, local AI on their own hardware  
- **Community Growth**: Foster open collaboration and innovation
- **Project Sustainability**: Generate revenue from commercial success while keeping the core accessible
- **Privacy by Design**: Promote local-first, private AI that users fully control

### What is Always Free

You may use PocketCloud at no charge if **any** of the following is true:

1. **Personal Use**: You are an individual using it for yourself, including at work
2. **Small Organizations**: Your company has < 10 employees AND < $1M USD in annual revenue  
3. **Early Products**: The product or service that uses PocketCloud generates < $250k USD in annual revenue

If any of these apply, PocketCloud is **free with no registration required**.

### Commercial Licensing

If your organization or product **exceeds these thresholds** AND PocketCloud is a **core component** of:
- A product or service you sell
- Internal tools that drive significant cost savings or revenue

You must obtain a **commercial license** from the Pocket Cloud Foundation.
